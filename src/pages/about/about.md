I have been interested in computers since childhood and pursued a degree in electrical and communication engineering at university. During my graduate studies, I actively engaged in research, earning two conference awards and having one paper published in a journal. I graduated at the top of my class. In my professional career, I have worked as an infrastructure engineer, starting with OS installations and server racking in data centers, and moving on to scratch installations, maintenance, and operations of large-scale storage systems like Ceph, Kubernetes, and Zabbix. Through these experiences, I have demonstrated my ability to manage and operate complex systems, solve problems quickly, and provide reliable leadership. 

My hobbies include collecting smartphones, evaluating 4G/5G communication speeds (I love speedtest.net), and running.
